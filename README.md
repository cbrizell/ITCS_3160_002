Outline:

  Introduction:
  
    create a test database for a campus controlled food delivery service 
similar to craveoncampus.com (think of reverse engineering the database on their site as 
evidenced by descriptions of their system and activities on the site).  You can also look at 
grubhub and ubereats for ideas.  Please remember this is a prototype for the database not 
a fully implemented working model.
  
  Use Case:
  
    Users, System, Restaurant, Driver
    1.Users access system with their location
    2.system presents restaurants and their options based on location
    3.user chooses options and pays through system
    4.system processes order, payment and submits information to restaurant
    5.driver accepts job and picks up food at restaurant
    6.driver takes food to user's location
    7.user recieves food from driver
    Goal: User is able to order and recieve food correctly and in an acceptable timeframe, restaurant is able to recieve and process the proper order and driver is able to pickup and deliver food correctly.
